<H2><A NAME="s1">1.</A> <A HREF="#toc1">Overview</A></H2>


<P>This file contains an overview of the F256jr runtime system as provided by this project, for the
cc65 C compiler. The F256jr library is not an official part of cc65 and may have errors, bugs, and generally suck. This file describes the memory layout, F256jr-specific header files,
available drivers, and any pitfalls specific to that platform.</P>
<P>Please note that F256jr-specific functions are just mentioned here, they are
described in detail in the separate 
<A HREF="funcref.html">function reference</A>. Even functions marked as "platform dependent" may be available on
more than one platform. Please see the function reference for more
information.</P>


<H2><A NAME="s2">2.</A> <A HREF="#toc2">Binary format</A></H2>


<P>The standard binary output format generated by the linker for the F256jr target
is a machine language program. If you can manage to load it on the F256jr with the debug port, you may be able to launch it from SuperBASIC with "call $300" (or whereever your startup code is). Alternatively, if you start from Foenix DOS, you can use "exec $300" (or your startup address). I fully anticipate we will be able to load and start cc65 programs from within SuperBASIC in the near future. (As of the time of writing SuperBASIC doesn't have load/save functionality working). </P>


<H2><A NAME="s3">3.</A> <A HREF="#toc3">Memory layout</A></H2>


<P>cc65 generated programs with the default setup assume you will have a standard MMU configuration (that you set yourself) where 65C02 banks 0-5 are matched to physical banks 0-5, with bank 6 (IO) not used for MAIN, and bank 7 (kernel) not used at all. If you are using an overlay configuration, cc65 expects all overlays to be 8K or less, and reside in bank 05 ($a000-$bffff).</p>
<P>The setup gives a usable memory range of $0400 - $9fff: about 39k continguous for MAIN and the C stack. You can also have up to 9 "overlays" mapped into the $a000-bfff space. If you do not user overlays, you can use this 8k for MAIN. </P>
<P>Special locations:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Stack</B><DD>
<P>The C runtime stack is located at $9FFF (if using overlays) or $BFFF (if not using overlays), and growing downwards.</P>

<DT><B>Heap</B><DD>
<P>The C heap is located at the end of the program, and grows towards the C
runtime stack.</P>

</DL>
</P>




<H2><A NAME="s4">4.</A> <A HREF="#toc4">Platform-specific header files</A></H2>


<P>Programs containing F256jr-specific code may use the <CODE>f256jr.h</CODE> header file.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="#toc4.1">F256jr-specific functions</A>
</H2>


<P>The functions listed below are special for the F256jr. See the 
<A HREF="smellybutt.html">non-existent function reference</A> for declaration and usage.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>TBD1</LI>
<LI>TBD2</LI>
</UL>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2</A> <A HREF="#toc4.2">F256jr-specific accelerator functions</A>
</H2>


<P>There are no accelerator functions for the F256jr, largely due to the fact that no accelerators exist for the machine.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5</A> <A HREF="#toc4.5">Hardware access</A>
</H2>


<P>The following pseudo variables declared in the <CODE>f256jr.h</CODE> header file do
allow access to hardware located in the address space. Some variables are
structures, accessing the struct fields will access the chip registers.</P>
<P>
<DL>

<DT><B><CODE>none yet -- stay tuned!</CODE></B><DD>
<P>May add items as necessary. For now, reference the macros defined.</P>

</DL>
</P>




<H2><A NAME="s5">5.</A> <A HREF="#toc5">Loadable drivers</A></H2>


<P>The names in the parentheses denote the symbols to be used for static linking of the drivers.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1</A> <A HREF="#toc5.1">Graphics drivers</A>
</H2>


<P>There are no graphics drivers yet for the F256jr, but adapting existing drivers would not be complicated. Volunteers wanted!</P>
<P>
<DL>

<DT><B><CODE>f256jr.tgi (f256jr_tgi)</CODE></B><DD>
<P>This driver features a resolution of 320&times;200 with 256 colors and an
adjustable palette (that means that the two colors can be chosen out of a
palette of the 16M colors). This driver does not exist. Perhaps you would like to write it? </P>

</DL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2</A> <A HREF="#toc5.2">Extended memory drivers</A>
</H2>


<P>There are no extended memory drivers for the F256jr, because they are not needed. It is not necessary to COPY data from "extended" memory to 65C02 memory: you can simply map it into 65C02 space using the MMU. This is 8.25 million times faster, and saves you the 300-600 bytes the driver would take up. </P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3</A> <A HREF="#toc5.3">Joystick drivers</A>
</H2>


<P>The default drivers, <CODE>joy_stddrv (joy_static_stddrv)</CODE>, point to <CODE>f256jr-stdjoy.joy (f256jr_stdjoy_joy)</CODE>. Or they would, if anyone had written them. TODO!</P>
<P>
<DL>

<DT><B><CODE>f256jr-stdjoy.joy (f256jr_stdjoy_joy)</CODE></B><DD>
<P>Supports up to two joysticks connected to the standard joysticks ports of the F256jr. Note: this driver exists only in your head.</P>
</DL>
</P>




<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4</A> <A HREF="#toc5.4">Mouse drivers</A>
</H2>


<P>The default drivers, <CODE>mouse_stddrv (mouse_static_stddrv)</CODE>, point to <CODE>f256jr-ps2.mou (f256jr_ps2_mou)</CODE>. Just kidding. They don't, because I didn't write any mouse drivers. I have a JR, not a K, so I need the ps/2 port for you know... a keyboard. Let's come back to this when the F256Ks ship.</P>
<P>
<DL>

<DT><B><CODE>f256jr-ps2.mou (f256jr_ps2_mou)</CODE></B><DD>
<P>Supports a standard mouse connected to the ps/2 port of the F256jr.</P>

<DT><B><CODE>f256jr-joy-1350.mou (f256jr_joy_1350_mou)</CODE></B><DD>
<P>Supports a mouse emulated by a standard joystick, e.g. 1350 mouse, in port
#1 of the F256jr. This is an interesting concept... should we do this? Anyone have a 1350 mouse? </P>

</DL>
</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5</A> <A HREF="#toc5.5">RS232 device drivers</A>
</H2>


<P>There are no serial drivers yet. Who wants to write one?</P>

</DL>
</P>




<H2><A NAME="s6">6.</A> <A HREF="#toc6">Limitations</A></H2>




<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1</A> <A HREF="#toc6.1">Nothing worth mentioning</A>
</H2>


<P>I'm sure people will think of something once they start using this library...</P>



<H2><A NAME="s7">7.</A> <A HREF="#toc7">Other hints</A></H2>




<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1</A> <A HREF="#toc7.1">Passing arguments to the program</A>
</H2>


<P>This is what the C128 library for cc65 says: Command-line arguments can be passed to <CODE>main()</CODE>. Since this is not
supported directly by BASIC, the following syntax was chosen:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    RUN:REM ARG1 " ARG2 IS QUOTED" ARG3 "" ARG5
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Should we try to do something like that for the F256jr? Let's see how things go with SuperBASIC...
</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Arguments are separated by spaces.</LI>
<LI>Arguments may be quoted.</LI>
<LI>Leading and trailing spaces around an argument are ignored. Spaces within
a quoted argument are allowed.</LI>
<LI>The first argument passed to <CODE>main()</CODE> is the program name.</LI>
<LI>A maximum number of 10 arguments (including the program name) are
supported.</LI>
</OL>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2</A> <A HREF="#toc7.2">Program return code</A>
</H2>


<P>The program return code (low byte) is passed back to BASIC by use of the
<CODE>ST</CODE> variable. TODO.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3</A> <A HREF="#toc7.3">Interrupts</A>
</H2>


<P>The runtime for the F256jr uses routines marked as <CODE>.INTERRUPTOR</CODE> for
interrupt handlers. Such routines must be written as simple machine language
subroutines and will be called automatically by the interrupt handler code
when they are linked into a program. See the discussion of the <CODE>.CONDES</CODE>
feature in the 
<A HREF="ca65.html">assembler manual</A>. NOTE: the library does not yet have support for interrupts.</P>
